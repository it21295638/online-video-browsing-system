Contributed OOP playlist management code in 2nd-year first-semester group project
This repository contains the code for my second-year, first-semester project related to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) module.

In this group project, which involved four members, I was primarily responsible for implementing playlist management functionalities. My tasks included:

- Adding new playlists
- Deleting existing playlists
- Viewing playlists
- Updating playlists
  
The code in this repository specifically corresponds to my contributions related to playlist management.
